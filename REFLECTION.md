This project was a bear for me. I have a tendency to bite off more than I can chew, and I definitely did that with this project. That being said, this project does have a lot of good information in it and was a good learning experience. Just doing the red-black tree was an experience all its own.

I've had a loose grasp on some of these primitive data structures for a while now professionally, but I rarely use a lot of them on a day to day basis. This project helped me sharpen those skills. Not only that, but I do think that the implementations being up on Github can be helpful as reference for others in the Swift community. 

If I could do it again, I'd definitely slow myself down some and not take on so much. Even though I got a head start on the project, between work, kids, and launching my first iOS app, I didn't leave myself much wiggle room. I also underestimated the complexity of some of the data structures, specifically Red-Black trees. I knew they were kind of difficult from my time studying for an interview I had with Facebook, but the nitty-gritty of the actual implementation got really tedious and time consuming after a while.

As with all software development, though, estimation is always the tough part (and naming things, of course...). 

If you have any questions about anything in my project, let me know. There was so much to do, hopefully I got the lion-share of everything I promised done and then some. I feel fairly hopeful with this project though even if it's rough around the edges.
